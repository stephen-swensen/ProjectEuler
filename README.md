# ProjectEuler
This repository includes the original source code to my solutions in F# to the first 50 Project Euler problems as document in my blog at http://projecteulerfun.blogspot.com/.

At this time, the solution is dependant on VS 2010 and has a number for project reference which assume certain GAC installations. As such, you may have trouble compiling as is. One day, I may update to a later version of VS with proper NuGet dependencies that don't make any local computer assumptions.
